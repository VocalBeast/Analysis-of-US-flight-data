# Analysis-of-US-flight-data
Context - The 2009 ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo consisted of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights on major carriers within the USA from October 1987 to April 2008.

In this analysis, I have taken flight arrival and departure details from the years of 2006 and 2007, and have conducted analysis in python to do the following:

(a) Evaluate what are the best times and days of the week to minimise delays each year.

(b) Evaluate whether older planes suffer more delays on a year-to-year basis.

(c) For each year, fit a logistic regression model for the probability of diverted US flights using as many features as possible from attributes of the departure date, the scheduled departure and arrival times, the coordinates and distance between departure and planned arrival airports, and the carrier. Visualize the coefficients across years.
